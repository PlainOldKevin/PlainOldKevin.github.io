## About Me
Hi there, I'm Kevin Conway and I'm from Point Pleasant, NJ. I attended high school at
Christian Brothers Academy in Lincroft, NJ and currently attend Quinnipiac University.
I have always been interested in software and how computers work which is what got me
into Computer Science/programming. Some of my current interests/favorite activities are
watching sports, going to the gym, going to the beach, hanging out with friends, and
playing video games.
